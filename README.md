PCA_MI_GeneFeatureExtraction

Overview

PCA_MI_GeneFeatureExtraction is a repository designed for gene feature extraction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Mutual Information (MI) methods. This project focuses on identifying significant genes and performing network analysis, including hub gene detection. The final hybrid model integrates additional important genes and presents the results through various evaluation metrics and visual representations.

Repository Structure

FinalCodeForO3.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for executing PCA and MI for gene feature extraction, along with the implementation of the hybrid model. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and results generation.

Evaluation_Matrices/: This directory contains zip folders with evaluation matrices. Each zip folder includes:

Final confusion matrix

Various performance metrics

Graphs and plots that visualize the results

Network_Analysis/: This directory houses files related to network analysis and hub gene detection, emphasizing the connections and importance of various genes.

Key Features

PCA and MI for Feature Extraction: Utilizes Principal Component Analysis and Mutual Information to extract significant gene features.

Hybrid Model: A combination of various gene selection methods to enhance the predictive power of the model. The hybrid model identifies additional important genes and integrates them into the analysis.

Network Analysis: Includes network analysis to determine gene interactions and identify hub genes that play crucial roles in the network.

Comprehensive Evaluation: The repository includes multiple evaluation metrics such as confusion matrices, precision, recall, F1 scores, and graphical representations of the results.

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PCA_MI_GeneFeatureExtraction.git
